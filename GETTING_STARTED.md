# Getting Started with "What Is"

Welcome to "What Is", your intelligent, keyboard-centric AI companion for Windows. This guide will help you get set up and mastering your new productivity tool in no time.

## 1. Installation & Setup

1.  **Launch the App**: Run the executable file (`what_is.exe`).
2.  **Onboarding**: On the first run, you'll see a welcome screen.
    *   **API Key**: You need a Google Gemini API Key. If you don't have one, get it for free [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    *   **Enter Key**: Paste your API key into the input field and confirm.
3.  **Ready**: Once the key is saved, the app is ready to use. It will minimize to the system tray (look for the "What Is" icon near your clock).

## 2. Core Concepts

"What Is" is designed to be invisible until you need it. It operates via **Global Hotkeys**, meaning you can trigger it from *any* application (browser, IDE, document, etc.) without clicking around.

### The Three Modes

1.  **Explain Mode** (`Ctrl` + `Alt` + `E`)
    *   *Best for:* General questions, definitions, concepts.
    *   *Example:* "What is the difference between TCP and UDP?"

2.  **Code Mode** (`Ctrl` + `Alt` + `C`)
    *   *Best for:* Programming questions, debugging, snippets.
    *   *Example:* "Write a Python function to reverse a list."

3.  **Translate Mode** (`Ctrl` + `Alt` + `T`)
    *   *Best for:* Translating text to your target language (configurable in Settings).
    *   *Example:* "Hello world" -> "Bonjour le monde"

## 3. Workflow Examples

### Scenario A: The "Quick Question"
1.  You are reading an article and see a term you don't know.
2.  Press `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `E`. The app window appears instantly.
3.  Type your question and press `Enter`.
4.  Read the answer.
5.  Press `Esc` to dismiss the app and go back to reading.

### Scenario B: The "Smart Paste"
1.  Select text in any app (e.g., an error message in your terminal).
2.  Copy it (`Ctrl` + `C`).
3.  Press `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `V` (Paste & Analyze).
4.  The app opens, pastes the text, and you can immediately select a mode (e.g., Code Mode) to get an explanation for the error.

## 4. Customization

Click the **Gear Icon** in the top-right corner of the app window to open Settings.

*   **API Key**: Update your key if needed.
*   **Response Style**: Choose between "Concise" (short), "Normal", or "Detailed".
*   **Target Language**: Set the language for translations.
*   **Hotkeys**:
    *   Don't like `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `E`? Click on the recording button next to the action and press your own combination (e.g., `Alt` + `Space`).

## 5. Troubleshooting

*   **App won't open?** Check the system tray. If the icon is there, the app is running. Right-click it and select "Show".
*   **API Error?** Your API key might be invalid or expired. Check your internet connection and re-enter the key in Settings.
